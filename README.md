# comparing between to model
in this project we are trying to make model for diagnosing breast cancer we will use two algorithms to find best model:Logistic-Regression and Naive_Bayes

 # Attribute Information:

1) ID number

2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

3)other columns:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
